# `@yantra-core/mantra`

## Introduction

Welcome to `@yantra-core/mantra` â€“  a versatile framework revolutionizing game development. Everything is a Plugin in Mantra, including the Physics and Graphics engines. Mantra currently supports Babylon.js, Phaser.js, and Matter.js. 3D Physics via wasm is [coming soon](#features)!

Mantra is designed for high-performance serverless physics and multiplayer environments while still making it easy to start up and quickly develop a local offline game.

### Core Features
- [X] **Entities, Components, Systems**: Enterprise-grade ECS for game development
- [X] **Modular Plugin System**: Facilitating easier extension and customization.
- [X] **Edge Computing Compatible**: Games can run in CloudFlare Workers environments.
- [X] **Offline Gameplay Support**: Fully functional gameplay in offline mode.

### Alpha Software Notice
As alpha software, `@yantra-core/mantra` is currently under active development. [Features](#Features) are being added and refined. Users should anticipate changes and potential instabilities. Your feedback and contributions at this stage are invaluable and will shape the future of this framework.

# Core Packages

  - `@yantra-core/mantra` - Core API + Plugins
  - `@yantra-core/server` - Self-hosted Websocket Server
  - `@yantra-core/edge`   - Run your authoritative server on Cloudflare Edge Workers
  - `@yantra-core/client` - Browser-based Mantra Client with offline support

## Creating your first Mantra Game

**Client**
```js
let game = new Game();

// Use Plugins to add systems to the game
game
  .use(new MatterPhysics())
  .use(new Collision())
  .use(new EntityFactory())
  .use(new EntityInput())
  .use(new EntityMovement(new AsteroidsMovement()))
  .use(new Bullet())

// Since this is the Client, we can add Keyboard and Graphics 
game
  .use(new BabylonGraphics())
  .use(new Mesh())
  .use(new Camera())
  .use(new StarField())
  .use(new KeyboardBrowser());

game.connect('ws://localhost:8888');
```

**Server**
```js
let game = new Game({ isServer: true });

// Use Plugins to add systems to the game
game
  .use(new MatterPhysics())
  .use(new Collision())
  .use(new EntityFactory())
  .use(new EntityInput())
  .use(new EntityMovement(new AsteroidsMovement()))
  .use(new Lifetime())
  .use(new Bullet())
  .use(new WebSocketServer());

game.listen(8888);
```
  
  
## Game API
### Entity API

```js
game.getEntity(entityId);
game.createEntity(entityData)
game.updateEntity(entityData)
game.destroyEntity(entityId)
```

### Component API

```js
game.getComponent(entityId, componentType)
game.addComponent(entityId, componentType, data)
```

### System API

```js
game.getSystem(systemName)
game.addSystem(systemName, system)
game.removeSystem(systemName)
```

### Snapshot API

```js
game.getPlayerSnapshot(playerId)
game.getSnapshot(snapshotId)
```

### Plugins API

```js
game.use(pluginInstance)
```
